# Hybrid-Deep-Learning-for-Cotton-Leaf-Disease-Detection
eveloped an hybrid image classification system to detect and classify cotton leaf diseases for early agricultural diagnosis. • Leveraged transfer learning with pretrained CNN models (VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121) and applied ensemble classifiers to improve prediction robustness.
