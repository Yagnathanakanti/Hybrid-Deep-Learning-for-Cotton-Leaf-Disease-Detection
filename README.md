# 📌 Crop Disease Detection System

This repository contains a **Crop Disease Detection System** built using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal of this project is to automatically detect and classify crop diseases from leaf images to support farmers and agricultural researchers in early diagnosis and better crop management.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Crop diseases can significantly reduce agricultural yield, so building automated systems to detect disease symptoms can help prevent losses and improve food production. This project uses image classification and computer vision to identify various plant diseases from leaf images.

## 🛠 Features

- Classifies healthy vs diseased crop leaves  
- Uses deep learning models (e.g., CNNs)  
- Works with real image datasets of crop diseases  
- Easy to run locally or in Google Colab/Jupyter

## 📦 Dataset

We use publicly available crop disease datasets that include thousands of labeled images of crop leaves in different disease categories.

### 📍 Main Dataset: **KAGGLE DATASET**
In this project we use the Cotton Leaf Disease dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
This dataset contains real-world images of cotton leaves labeled into four classes:

Bacterial Blight

Curl Virus

Fusarium Wilt

Healthy Leaves

There are a total of 1710 images in the dataset, captured both in real field conditions and from internet sources, making it suitable for training and evaluating deep learning models for cotton disease classification.
